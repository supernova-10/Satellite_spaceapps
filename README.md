# Satellite_spaceapps

Nasa spaceapps competition 2023, this it the project that my team and I presented. 

It makes you experience going from the space, containing satellites, to the sea which contains what we were studying, fish. 

starting from satellite shows the importance of data collected as we go down, data helps improve renewable energy methods and helps us understand the ocean.
